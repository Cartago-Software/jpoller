JPOLLER - Java directory polling framework
=======================================

This fork is based on the original jpoller [from SourceForge]( https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpoller/
) which has being imported to GitHub by the original author Cristiano Sadun. We have forked the original project so that we can maintain it for use in our own software and to make the license as provided in comments by Mr. Sadun is actually visible in the project as well as in the tagged versions.

We are basing our version on the last upload which was 1.52.0. To distinguish our changes from the original we have added the qualifier -CARTAGO.

Differences between this and the original is that we have removed all extraneous classes that have nothing to do with the JPOLLER project, and it is now buildable in Maven.
